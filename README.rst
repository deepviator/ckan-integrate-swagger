CKAN & SWAGGER UI Integrate Project
==========================================



CKAN
==========================================

**CKAN is the world’s leading open-source data portal platform**.
CKAN makes it easy to publish, share and work with data. It's a data management
system that provides a powerful platform for cataloging, storing and accessing
datasets with a rich front-end, full API (for both data and catalog), visualization
tools and more. Read more at `ckan.org <http://ckan.org/>`_.

CKAN's original sorce code can be found on https://github.com/ckan/ckan

The Swagger Specification
==========================================
The goal of Swagger™ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST 
APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the 
capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through 
network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand 
and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. 
Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the 
guesswork in calling the service.
